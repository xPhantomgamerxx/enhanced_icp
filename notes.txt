Given the high density of the projected points in your image, whole image processing is likely the better approach. Here's why:
    Redundancy Reduction: You avoid redundant computation by generating the feature map once for the entire image.
    Consistency: Features extracted from a global map are more consistent and better reflect the semantic structure of the scene.
    Efficiency: Whole image processing leverages the efficiency of batch CNN inference, reducing computational overhead compared to point-wise inference.

Your suggestion is excellent! 
By using the OXTS transformations as the "ground truth," you can effectively benchmark your ICP implementation across different configurations (e.g., no semantic features vs. various levels of semantic features). 
This approach allows you to quantify the performance improvement introduced by semantic features.

Initial Semantic ICP is shit, with see figures
